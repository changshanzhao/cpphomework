# Reminder
Project can be compiled automatically in Windows(By using Clion) and Linux.

in Linux, you are supposed:>

```shell
cd ./cpphomework
chmod +x AutoBuild.sh
./AutoBuild.sh
```

# Cautions
1. Sadly and unsatisfying, you may need to change the decode mode(to GBK, but I switch to it then find it not work!) To Possibly utf-16(Anyway I FAILED :(.
2. Due to the decode mode, Results of checking/searching and writing Chinese may be incorrect!This is the place you can fix(THEN TEACH ME!!!!)
